WebAuth
========

This is a collection of scripts that power the authentication on [http://wma.im/register](The Worldwide Minecraft Alliance). Huge thanks to @barneygale, @BoomBox for proving scripts and support to get this all working perfectly!

Within standalone-python-server/ you will find purposefully modified files from [https://github.com/barneygale/authserver](this auth server) by @barneygale.

Within web-forms/ you will find three purpose-built scripts. These will create entries in a MySQL database which is then accessed by the python server.

Below we will also include the basic MySQL commands to create a table for the above scripts to use.
